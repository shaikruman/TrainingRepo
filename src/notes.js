//AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded
Update a web page without reloading the page
Send data to a web server - in the background

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

AJAX is not a programming language.

AJAX just uses a combination of:

A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

axios: it is a api, using this axios api we can send a request to server without submitting
the web page. we can use this package to work with ajax.

ajax is a technology, used to send request to server without submitting web page
